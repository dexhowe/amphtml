## Quickstart

`amp-html` provides the necessary boilerplate to get going with AMP.

The extended snippets require you to include a corresponding `<script>` tag in the header. These snippets end with the `-script` suffix. As an example, the mustache snippet (`amp-mustache`) is used with the corresponding `amp-mustache-script` snippet.
